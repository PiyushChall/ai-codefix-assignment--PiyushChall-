SSRF Remediation Guidelines:

1. Never allow user input to control internal network requests directly.
2. Implement an allowlist of permitted domains.
3. Block requests to private/internal IP ranges (169.x, 10.x, 192.168.x, etc.).
4. Disable HTTP redirects when fetching external URLs.
5. Restrict outbound protocols to HTTP/HTTPS only.
6. Use URL parsing and validation to prevent protocol abuse.
