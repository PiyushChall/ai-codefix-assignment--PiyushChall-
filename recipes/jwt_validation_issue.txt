JWT Validation Issue Remediation Guidelines:

1. Always validate the JWT signature before trusting any claims.
2. Ensure the correct algorithm is enforced (e.g., do not allow 'none').
3. Validate expiration (exp), not-before (nbf), and issued-at (iat) claims.
4. Use secure and unique signing keys.
5. Do not place sensitive data in JWT payloads.
6. Rotate signing keys periodically and invalidate old tokens.
