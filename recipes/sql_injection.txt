SQL Injection Remediation Guidelines:

1. Always use parameterized queries (PreparedStatement, SqlParameter, etc.).
2. Never concatenate user input directly into SQL statements.
3. Validate and sanitize all external inputs.
4. Use least-privilege database accounts.
5. Avoid dynamic SQL unless absolutely necessary.
6. Escape special characters only as a fallback, not a primary defense.
