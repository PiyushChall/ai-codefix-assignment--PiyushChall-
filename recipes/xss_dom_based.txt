DOM-Based XSS Remediation Guidelines:

1. Never insert raw user input directly into the DOM.
2. Use safe DOM APIs such as textContent instead of innerHTML.
3. Validate, encode, or sanitize all user-controlled data before rendering.
4. Apply appropriate output encoding (HTML, JS, URL) based on context.
5. Disable unsafe inline event handlers when possible.
6. Use library-based sanitization (DOMPurify, etc.) when handling HTML content.
