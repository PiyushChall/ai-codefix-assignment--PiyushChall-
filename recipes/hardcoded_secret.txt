Hardcoded Secret Remediation Guidelines:

1. Never store secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) directly in source code.
2. Use environment variables or a secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).
3. Ensure secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit.
4. Rotate credentials regularly.
5. Remove any exposed keys and regenerate them immediately.
6. Add secrets files to .gitignore to avoid version control leaks.
